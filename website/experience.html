            <h1>University of Pittsburgh Java Class</h1>
            <p>
            An introductory Java programming class that provided a solid foundation in computer 
            programming using the Java language taken in highschool. Throughout the course, 
            I explored fundamental programming concepts, including 
            variables, data types, loops, and conditionals. I delved into 
            the principles of object-oriented programming, learning about classes, objects, 
            and recursion. The course emphasized proper coding conventions and syntax, ensuring 
            that I developed good programming practices. Practical skills such as working with 
            data structures like arrays and collections were included in the course. Additionally, I gained experience 
            with file input/output. Throughout the class, I  applied 
            my knowledge to coding projects that reinforce my understanding of the material. 
            The course also focused on debugging techniques and troubleshooting to help 
            us identify and fix errors in their Java programs. Assessment includes
            assignments, quizzes, coding projects, and a final exam, providing a 
            comprehensive evaluation of our Java programming skills.

            <p>
            Throughout the course, I gained a solid understanding of the 
            fundamentals of computer programming using the Python language. I learned about essential concepts like variables, data types, and 
            control structures, which are the building blocks of programming. I also delved 
            into Python's simplicity and readability, appreciated its clean and intuitive 
            syntax, and gained hands-on experience with practical skills like input and output, 
            data manipulation, and working with lists and dictionaries. The class emphasized 
            problem-solving and logical thinking through coding projects, and I acquired valuable 
            debugging and troubleshooting techniques. Overall, this introductory Python class 
            provided me with a strong foundation in programming, boosting my confidence as a 
            programmer and preparing me for further exploration in the world of coding

            <h1 >Machine Learning Bootcamp</h1>
            <p>
                Attending the machine learning bootcamp was a transformative experience for me. 
                Over the course of the program, I gained a solid understanding of the basics 
                of machine learning and how to apply them effectively. From grasping the 
                concepts of supervised and unsupervised learning to working with popular 
                libraries and frameworks, the bootcamp equipped me with the knowledge and 
                hands-on skills I needed to dive into the world of machine learning. 
                The practical projects and real-world applications we explored during the 
                bootcamp allowed me to see the immediate impact and potential of this field. 
                It was a journey that not only expanded my horizons but also ignited a passion 
                for solving complex problems with data-driven solutions.
