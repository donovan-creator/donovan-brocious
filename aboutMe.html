    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I'm Donovan Brocious, a coding enthusiast. My love for software engineering started in middle school when I took my first coding class. 
        Seeing how lines of code can turn into programs and experiencing the joy of facing a problem and solving it with code led me to explore coding further, 
        both inside and outside of school. I was an active participant in both my high school's coding club and robotics club, which allowed me to pursue software 
        engineering more deeply. Additionally, I gained work experience at a local grocery store and Chipotle, where I nearly became a manager. This experience led me to 
        becoming certified by ServSafe as a food safety manager, demonstrating my ability to apply myself and showcasing my work ethic. These jobs also taught me imperative 
        skills such as teamwork, collaboration, and communication, which I continue to utilize today. One of my primary goals is to get involved in the software engineering 
        industry as an intern, seizing the opportunity to learn from professionals in the field.
